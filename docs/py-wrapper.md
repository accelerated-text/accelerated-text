# Python wrapper

You can interact with Accelerated Text using our [Python wrapper](https://github.com/tokenmill/accelerated-text-py/).

Main functions of the wrapper include:
- Interaction with dictionary, document-plans and data-files
- Altering languages and readers
- Text generation
- Working with state

We encourage using [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) alongside it.
