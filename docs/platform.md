Accelerated Text is a visual programming platform. At the highest level, it uses (Google Blockly)[https://developers.google.com/blockly/] environment that lets users build text somewhat similar to assembling a jigsaw puzzle. When the main structure, called document plan, is built, it then goes through a series of steps, getting transformed into [Grammatical Framework](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/) code before finally coming back as text.

There are three levels of planning, each having its own environment and purpose:

* **Document Plan Editor** is the top-level editor used to build text on a paragraph level
* **AMR Editor** is the mid-level editor that mostly deals with sentence building
* **DLG Editor** is the lowest level editor where simple clauses are built

Each of the editors are presented below.
