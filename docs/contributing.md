# Contributing to Accelerated Text

*First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!*

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Accelerated Text and its packages, which are hosted in the TokenMill organization on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Did you find a bug?

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

If you come up with some new interesting feature, and want to share it with us, just submit a PR. 

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
