# Accelerated Text Help

## Sidebars

Sidebars provide controls to manage your data and control text generation.

### Data

*Data* sidebar provides the tools to load CSV data files to be used in generation. Note that CSV files have to be comma separated with the column headers at the top.

More than one data file can be loaded with the help of *Add* button. File selected in the drop down menu is a current one and will be used for the generation.

Contents of the current data file are displayed in the table bellow. Active row can be selected with the controls at the top of the table

### Text Generation Results

This section will show the resulting texts. Each block of text represents variations of the text given the same document plan and current row of data. A frag next to text shows the language of the text.

In cases when no text can be generated (due to missconstructed document plan), you will see 'No Variants.' message.

### AMR

This is a core element of the Accelerated Text engine. AMR - Abstract Meaning Representations - define what kind of messages can be constructed about the data. Choose from the AMR list bellow what you want to communicate to your users. AMR must be dragged to the Document Plan canvas to the left (Document Plan construction is described in the section bellow).

### Dictionary

Dictionary section shows which words are available to construct your multilanguage document plans. Note that dictionary entries specify all the forms of the word: gender, case, number.

Just as with AMRs dictionary elements need to be dragged into Document Plan canvas to the left.

## Document Plan construction

Document Plan defines how the text should be generated by choosing appropriate AMRs, dictionary items and data elements from the sample CSV.
Plan builder follows visual programming paradigm to define generation logic. The white canvas area in the center of the application is where you define the plan.

Top section of Document Plan Builder has a toolbar with all the necessary elements for the plan construction.
