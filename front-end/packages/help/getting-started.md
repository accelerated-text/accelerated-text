# Accelerated Text Help

## Sidebars

Sidebars provide instruments to manage your data and control text generation.

![sidebars](help/sidebars.png)

### Data

*Data* sidebar provides the tools to load CSV data files to be used in generation. Note that CSV files have to be comma separated with the column headers at the top.

More than one data file can be loaded with the help of *Add* button. File selected in the drop down menu is a current one and will be used for the generation.

Contents of the current data file are displayed in the table bellow. Active row can be selected with the controls at the top of the table.

![data](help/data.png)

### Language

Language section shows which languages are supported in your installation. Language checkboxes select languages for text generation.

![data](help/language.png)

### Text Generation Results

This section will show the resulting texts. Each block of text represents variations of the text given the same document plan and current row of data. A flag next to text shows the language of the text.

![results](help/results.png)

In cases when no text can be generated (due to missconstructed document plan), you will see 'No Variants.' message.

### AMR

This is a core element of the Accelerated Text engine. AMR - Abstract Meaning Representations - define what kind of messages can be constructed about the data. Choose from the AMR list bellow what you want to communicate to your users. AMR must be dragged to the Document Plan canvas to the left (Document Plan construction elements are described in the section bellow).

### Dictionary

Dictionary section shows which words are available to construct your multilanguage document plans. Note that dictionary entries specify all the forms of the word: gender, case, number.

Just as with AMRs, dictionary elements need to be dragged into Document Plan canvas to the left.

## Document Plan construction

Document Plan defines how text is to be generated by choosing appropriate AMRs, dictionary items and data elements from the sample CSV.

Document Plan management: 
* creation of a new one, 
* selecting from existing ones, 
* changing the name and 
* deleting 
is done through the drop down list control at the top center section of the application.

Plan builder follows visual programming paradigm to define generation logic. White canvas area in the center of the application is where you define the plan.

Top section of Document Plan Builder has a toolbar with all the necessary elements for the plan construction.

### Document

High level document structure elements.
* *Text segment* - a thematic block of the text (roughly equivalent to paragraphs).
* *Set item* - define some reusable block of generation logic to be repeatedly used further in the plan.

### Values

Elements to specify data which will go into generation process. Note that *Data* sidebar is also a source of data elements, you can drag individual cells from the CSV table.

* *Some text* - any text you want to use in generation. Useful for boiler plate text as well as words not present in the *Dictionary*.
* *Item* - variable defined using *Set item* from *Documents* section.
* *a.n.* - adjective-noun construction to specify expressions like 'red shoe' (where 'a.' is 'red' and 'n.' is 'shoe')

### Lists

Handling of list elements - specify in which order elements enclosed in the list should be used.

* *sequence* - exact sequence of the enclosed elements.
* *in random order* - shuffle enclosed elements in a random order, thus producing variations in the text.
* *a synonym from* - chose one of the elements in the list, thus producing variations in the text.

### Logics

Text generation logic sometimes has to branch depending on the data supplied. Use *Logics* elements to control branching.

* *if-then-else* - main construct to specify branching logics, if a condition satisfies a *check* (see next section), then perform an action, else do some other action.
* *and* - a way to combine checks requiring them all to succeed.
* *or* - combine checks so that only one of them is required to succeed.
* *either-or-but-not-both* - combine two checks allowing only one of them to succeed.
* *not* - negate the check.

![logicstb](help/logics-tb.png)

### Checks

Checks are used in combination with *Logics* elements. Note that condition in the check element can be chosen from the drop down list.

* *=* - 'equality' condition
* *>* - 'more than' condition
* *is in* - this one allows to check if your value is in a list of certain values, for example is brand 'X' in a list of brands 'X, Y, Z'.
